description: Splattershmup is a game that explores the intersection of the classic shoot-em-up (or 'shmup') form and action-oriented art as popularized through 'action painting' (as popularized by American artist Jackson Pollock). In this way, it is a game that allows the player to reflect on their in-game actions and stragety through visual reflection, and to create art to be shared and discussed that comes 'from inside the moment' of action and decision.
