description: | Splattershmup is a game that explores the intersection
                of the classic shoot-em-up (or 'shmup') form and
                action-oriented art as popularized through 'action
                painting' (as popularized by American artist Jackson
                Pollock). In this way, it is a game that allows the player
                to reflect on their in-game actions and stragety through visual
                reflection, and to create art to be shared and discussed that
                comes 'from inside the moment' of action and decision.
